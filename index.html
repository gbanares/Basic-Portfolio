            <h1>A (little bit) About Me</h1>

            <p>What is there to really say? I'm more of an observer, a kind of 'behind the scenes' type of person. I
                have two young kids who surprise and encourage me each day. They challenge my wits and engage my thirst
                for knowledge.</p>
            <p>I started my coding journey with my trusty friend, the Compaq Presario 486. Life only got better when a
                simple AOL mailer came to my door that included free dial-up internet! The simple joys of how I tied up
                the family phone line for hours with the simple sounds of data being transferred with screams of "get
                off the phone!!" being heard. I'll spare you the details of how exciting it was to be at the store line
                to get Windows 98 (and installing those floppy disks!) through getting my first MacBook Pro. After the children, it is pretty much a blur now. </p>
            <p>Today, I'm a stay-at-home parent with a supportive and patient husband; trucking along this journey to
                reignite a career in the tech industry. On most days, I'm a driver, short-order cook, janitor,
                laundromat operator, and dishwasher. Luckily, on Monday, Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings, you
                will find me here.
